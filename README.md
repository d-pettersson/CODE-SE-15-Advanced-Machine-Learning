# Exploration in Deep Learning algorithms

This repository contains the semester work for the SE15 Advanced Machine Learning Module.
It is an exploration into the matter of Machine Learning algorithms, and more precisely Deep Learning for image synthesis.

This research is a preliminary work for an upcoming immersive interactive installation. The final outcome for this project (in the semester scope) is the generation of images sequences through interpolation, between two 'random' keyframes, or pre-generated keyframes.
These images sequences can then be converted to videos.

It currently is able to generate random images, random image sequences and keyframed image sequences.
